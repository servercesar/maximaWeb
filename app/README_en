Introduction to Yamwi
=====================


1. Objective
   --------- 

Yamwi (Yet Another Maxima Web Interface) is a web interface, based on 
Linux+Apache+Php, to the computer algebra system Maxima (maxima.sourceforge.net).

Maxima is the free version (GPL) of the Macsyma system developed in Lisp
at MIT during the 70's; other similar programs (Mathematica, Maple) got
inspired by it in the 80's. Since 2000 Maxima is part of Sourceforge and
maintained by an international team of programers. Due to its advanced
routines, Maxima is also used in research and technical contexts.

Yamwi is of interest in educational contexts, to make interactive activities
with the browser, or to show mathematical concepts.  All sorts of
computations and graphics can be made through the web by Yamwi.



2. Requirements
   -------------

The operating system to install Yamwi is Linux.

Software requirements on the server side:

* Apache (http://www.apache.org). (Ver. >= 2).
* Php (http://www.php.net). (Ver. >= 5).
* Gnuplot (http://www.gnuplot.info). This is the program used by 
  Maxima for rendering graphics. (Ver. >= 4.2).
* Maxima (http://maxima.sourceforge.net). This is the mathematical
  engine. (Ver. >= 5.20).
* timelimit

In case the administrator wants to render results in binary TeX format,
the following packages must be also installed (see configuration variable
'$mode' below):

* dvips (from LaTeX)
* texi2dvi (from texinfo)
* convert (from ImageMagick)



3. Installation
   ------------

Once installed the above mentioned programs, Yamwi's installation is
as easy as allocating the necessary files somewhere accesible for Apache.

Yamwi's sources can be downloaded from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/yamwi/files

This is the installation process:
(maybe you need root privileges)

1.- Download file yamwi-yy.mm.tar.gz, where yy stands for the year
    and mm for the month of release, and place it somewhere accesible
    from Apache. After that, untar it:

    tar -xvf yamwi-yy.mm.tar.gz

    which creates a new folder called 'yamwi'.

2.- Execute script INSTALL, it gives folders and files the neccesary
    permissions. It also creates temporary folder tmp, where working
    files will be allocated:

    sh yamwi/INSTALL

3.- Installation is now complete, in order to play with the demos just
    type the following address in your browser:

    http://localhost/path_to_folder/yamwi

    where path_to_folder is not necessary if Yamwi was installed in
    Apache's root system.

Near the beginning of file 'yamwi.php', there is a configuration section:

'$mode': 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4. When 0, Yamwi output is rendered in ASCII Art style;
    when 1, results are rendered in binary files containing TeX output (be sure
    programs texi2dvi, dvips and convert are installed); when 2, output is 
    rendered in enhanced ASCII-Art style, which is easier to read than mode 0;
    when 3, output is returned as a syntactical Maxima expression; when 4, 
    results are based on the nice looking MathJax (http://www.mathjax.org)
    system. Defaults to 2. Response times are shorter in ASCII Art modes.

'$max_file_time': Yamwi creates some files which are stored in folder
    'tmp'. Every time a user asks for a calculation, Yamwi removes those
    files older, in minutes, than the quantitity indicated by variable 
    '$max_inactive_time', which defaults to 1 minute.

'$max_process_time': maximum execution time allowed for every Maxima
    process. Default value is 120 sec.

'$max_num_processes': maximum number of Maxima processes simultaneously
     running on the server. Default value is 30.



4. User Add-ons
   ------------

Yamwi gives access to all standard Maxima packages. If you have
special needs, place in folder 'packages' your own packages, either with
'mac' extension, if it is written in Maxima code, or with 'lisp' extension,
if it is written in Common Lisp. Then visitors can invoque functions
defined in these packages by means of the 'load' command. See help file
help_en.html.



5. Security
   --------

Take care when using this program. To prevent server damages, some
barriers have been designed:

* There is a list of so called dangerous terms, which prevents user
  code to be passed to Maxima in case some of them are detected. See
  global variable '$dangerous_words'.
* The number of running Maxima processes can be limited at will. See
  configuration variable '$max_num_processes'.
* It is possible to limit the execution time of Maxima processes. See
  configuration variable '$max_process_time'.

Even with the existence of this filters, Yamwi does not guarantee 100%
server security.
